    <p>Astronomers announced today that they had discovered something new out in the dark: a stellar corpse too heavy to be a neutron star — the remnant of a supernova explosion — but not heavy enough to be a black hole.</p>

       <b> Whatever it once was, it is long gone. About 780 million years ago — and 780 light-years away — it was eaten by a black hole 23 times more massive than the sun. That feast left behind an even heavier black hole — a vast, hungry nothing with the mass of 25 suns.</b></br>
        
        News of that event only recently reached Earth, in the form of space-time ripples known as gravitational waves. These evanescent vibrations were felt on Aug. 14, 2019, by an array of antennas in Italy and the United States called the International LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, and the results were published on Tuesday in Astrophysical Journal Letters.
        
        <div>According to a theory that has been the backbone of decades of astrophysical excitement, a star can wind up in one of three final states, depending on its mass: a perpetually cooling cinder known as a white dwarf; a dense star, with the mass of a couple of suns compressed into a ball only 12 or so miles wide, known as a neutron star; or a black hole, a beast reluctantly predicted by Albert Einstein to be so dense that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity.</div>
